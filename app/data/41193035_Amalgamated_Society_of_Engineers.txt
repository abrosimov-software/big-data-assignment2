The Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE) was a major British trade union, representing factory workers and mechanics. ==History== The history of the union can be traced back to the formation of the Journeymen Steam Engine, Machine Makers' and Millwrights' Friendly Society, in 1826, popularly known as the "Old Mechanics".Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of British Trade Unions, vol.3, pp.12-16 Its secretary, William Allan, and another leading figure in the union, William Newton, proposed forming a new union to bring together skilled workers from all engineering trades."Newton, William", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography They invited a large number of other unions to become part a new Amalgamated Society of Engineers, Machinists, Smiths, Millwrights and Pattern-makers, which was soon shorted to the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE). Other than the Old Mechanics, the only notable union to join was the Smiths Benevolent, Sick and Burial Society. Together with various small, local unions, they brought 5,000 members into the ASE on its creation in 1851, Allan becoming its first general secretary. The ASE was one of the 'New Model Unions' of the 1850s-1870s. These unions, which also included the Ironfounders, Builders, and Carpenters' societies, rejected Chartism and the ideas of Robert Owen in favour of a more moderate policy based on 'prudence', 'respectability' and steady growth. Great importance was attached to the question of finance, as substantial funds would not only provide maintenance for members involved in strike action, but also help to deter the employers from attacking the organisation. Since its members were skilled and relatively highly paid, it was possible for the ASE to charge contributions of one shilling a week and to build up a fund of unprecedented proportions. Initially, there were strict restrictions on membership; all must have completed an apprenticeship in their trade, and men who wore glasses were not permitted to join. The ASE was an immediate success, and within a year, membership had more than doubled to 11,000. However, in 1852, it agreed a ban on overtime and piecework. In retaliation, employers began an extended national lockouts, which greatly weakened the organisation, an event repeated in 1896. But it maintained its pre-eminent position in the industry, and many local and regional unions joined. The union was invited to join the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades (FEST) when it was formed in 1891, but refused to do so. It also had a turbulent relationship with the Trades Union Congress (TUC), not holding membership in 1905 or from 1907 to 1918. However, it was a founder member of the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU). It finally joined the FEST in 1905, hoping to persuade its other members to amalgamate with it. Six small unions did so, but the other refused, and the ASE again left the FEST in 1918. The ASE set up overseas branches in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In 1891, they had only 5,000 members between them, but by 1920 they had grown to 32,000 members. The union set up an Australasian Council, and in 1906 a South African Council, and the branches in those countries thereafter had a considerable degree of autonomy. They had their own full-time secretaries and organisers, and became the leading unions for engineers in those countries. However, in North America, the union failed to grow. American Organiser Isaac Cowen prioritised strong links with the union in Britain, and the union there came to largely consist of British members who were temporarily working overseas. Many of them left in 1905 to join the Industrial Workers of the World, and the ASE decided in 1920 to transfer the remaining branches to the International Association of Machinists. In 1920, the ASE put out a fresh call for other unions to merge with it. Seventeen unions balloted their members on a possible merger, and nine voted in favour of amalgamation. Together, they formed the Amalgamated Engineering Union. ==Election results== The ASE was an early affiliate of the Labour Party. It sponsored candidates in each election from 1906 on, with several of its candidates winning election.Frank Bealey and Henry Pelling, Labour and Politics, 1900-1906 Election Constituency Candidate Votes Percentage Position 1906 general election Barrow-in-Furness 5,167 48.3 1 1906 general election Darlington 4,087 48.3 2 1906 general election Glasgow Blackfriars and Hutchesontown 3,284 39.5 1 1906 general election Great Grimsby 2,248 17.8 3 1906 general election Stockton-on-Tees 1,710 23.1 3 1910 January general election Barrow-in-Furness 5,304 55.2 1 1910 January general election Birmingham East 3,958 31.9 2 1910 January general election Crewe 1,380 09.5 3 1910 January general election Govan 3,545 23.3 3 1910 January general election Glasgow Blackfriars and Hutchesontown 4,496 61.7 1 1910 December general election Barrow-in-Furness 4,810 52.9 1The New Hazell Annual and Almanack, vol.26, p.361 1910 December general election Glasgow Blackfriars and Hutchesontown 4,162 59.1 1 1918 general election Bristol North 5,007 26.5 2 1918 general election Chatham 4,134 22.5 2 1918 general election Crewe 10,439 43.8 2 1918 general election Dumbarton Burghs 10,566 47.4 2 1918 general election Gateshead 7,212 23.8 2 1918 general election Gravesend 3,254 21.5 2 1918 general election Ilkeston 7,962 45.2 2Labour Party, Report of the Executive Committee (1918), pp.115 1918 general election Islington West 2,300 20.9 3 1918 general election Kennington 2,817 25.4 3 1918 general election Leeds North East 4,450 24.5 2Ed.
