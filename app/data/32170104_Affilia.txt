It was later reported that the manuscript included plagiarized sections from Chapter 12 of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf (My Struggle), in which Hitler describes why the Nazi Party is needed and what it requires of its members. The authors replaced Hitler's references to "National Socialism" with "feminism" and "Jews" with "privilege". The submission of the paper was an attempt to show the lack of rigor in some fields of academia, so-called "grievance studies", by demonstrating that absurdities and morally fashionable political ideas could get published as legitimate academic research in the field. ==See also== *List of women's studies journals ==References== ==External links== * Category:English-language journals Category:Academic journals established in 1986 Category:Quarterly journals Category:SAGE Publishing academic journals Category:Sociology journals Category:Women's studies journals
