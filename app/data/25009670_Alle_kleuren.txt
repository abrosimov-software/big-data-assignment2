Alle kleuren (English: All Colours) is the second studio album by the Belgian music trio K3. The album was released on 15 September 2000 through label Niels William. The album became a massive hit in Flanders and the Netherlands: it reached the peak position in both the Dutch and Flemish album charts. A few months after the original release, a limited edition, with two extra songs and some karaoke versions of original songs, was released. In 2008 a reissue was released with the original songs and an extra CD with karaoke versions of the songs. The first single from the album is called "Alle kleuren" and reached number two in the Ultratop 50. "Yippee yippee" is the second single from the album, a happy pop song. The third and fourth singles are "Oma's aan de top" and "Hippie shake". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits for Alle kleuren adapted from fan site. * Kathleen Aerts – vocals * Karen Damen – vocals * Peter Gillis – text, music, production, drums * Pietro Lacirignola – saxophone * Patrick Mortier – trumpet * Vincent Pierins – bass * Patrick Steenaerts – guitar * Alain Vande Putte – text, music * Kristel Verbeke – vocals * Rino Ver Eecke – vocals (radio voice-over) * Alexia Waku – vocals (background) * Miguel Wiels – text, music, production, keyboards ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2000) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2000) Position Belgian Albums Chart (Flanders) 2 Chart (2001) Position Belgian Albums Chart (Flanders) 1 Dutch Albums Chart 5 Chart (2002) Position Dutch Albums Chart 46 ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2001 albums Category:K3 (band) albums
