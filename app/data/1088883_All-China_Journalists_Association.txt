thumb|Headquarters of ACJA The All-China Journalists Association (ACJA) (), previously known as the 'Chinese Young Journalist Association', was established in Shanghai on November 8, 1937. November 8 now marks 'National Journalists Day' in China. The society was established by Chinese wartime reporter Fan Changjiang and later organized and sponsored by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). On September 15, 1949, the All China Journalist Association became the first Chinese media association to be formally recognized by, and integrated into, the International Federation of Journalists. Membership in the association is required for all professional journalists in China as overseen by the Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party. There are over 217 rural and industrial member organisations in the association, encompassing over 1 million individuals in the media industry in China. The All-China Journalists Association is also a member of the Belt and Road News Network, assisting in the network's establishment in 2017. == History == === Founding members === ==== Fan Changjiang ==== Fan Changjiang's career in journalism gained domestic notoriety in China during the Sino-Japanese war, attributed to his work as a war correspondent in regional China. During this period, he made observations of poverty in rural China in his book ‘The Northwest Corner of China’ (Zhongguo de Xibei Jiao), espousing his melancholy to see "bare-footed children…bound-footed women…plodding along’ on the “Refugee Trail". Fan Changjiang promoted engagement with, and development of, the journalistic profession in rural communities to increase the visibility of minority groups and their diverse experiences during the war and under the existing government. Changjiang became disillusioned with the Nationalist government during the Sino-Japanese war attributed to their perceived disregard for rural communities, and later aligned himself with the CCP. The Chinese journalist strongly advocated for transforming media practices in China, esteeming objective, factual reporting compared to commentarial pieces in inaccessible language created by his predecessors. Fan Changjiang launched the All-China Journalist Association to manifest this ideological shift, creating an organisation where techniques, styles and good reporting practices could be monitored and imparted upon reporters from localities across China and amongst China's various ethnic groups. Fan Changjiang also participated in opening the ‘Reporters Hostel’ to create a physical location where reporters could collectively gather and share practices and develop ideas. In honour of Fan Changjiang's contribution to the development of journalism and reporting in China, the All-China Journalist Association established the ‘Fan Changjiang Journalist Award’, the most prestigious journalist award in the nation. == Organisation Structure == === Executive Appointment Process === Board members of the All-China Journalist Association are appointed every five years and are typically high-ranking members of Chinese media institutions, domestically renowned reporters, notable public figures, and well-regarded editors. ==== President ==== ===== Zhang Yannong ===== President Zhang Yannong was born in 1948, joining the ‘People's Daily’ in 1996, one of China's three main state-influenced media organisations.

On June 4, 1989, Shao Huaze became the director of the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. This appointment followed the removal of existing director Qian Liren and chief editor Tan Wenrui who both had expressed disenfranchisement with the Chinese Communist Party attributed to their involvement in the Tiananmen Square Massacre. In response to this, Shao publicly condemned journalists for spreading "misleading" information about the government. Formally the president of the All-China Journalist society, Shao Huaze is now the honorary president. Shao Huaze has also been a member of the 15th, 14th and 9th General Committee and National Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. ==== Executive Vice President ==== ===== Liu Zhengrong ===== Liu Zhengrong is a member of the Chinese Communist party and the Deputy Chief of Internet Affairs at the Bureau of the State Council Information Office.

The initiative was launched in Kazakhstan at Nazarbayev University and in Indonesia in late 2013. The Belt and Road Initiative is of significance internationally attributed to China's inextricable and transnational economic integration, predominantly through its role in manufacturing but expanding into other industries such as technology. The Belt and Road Project has three predominant aspects: Overland, Technological, and Maritime. The Overland aspect includes coherent development of routes passing through Russia, Mongolia, the Middle East, Central Asia, Turkey and ending at Europe. The initiative's Maritime manifestation includes control and ability to facilitate trade and movements through the South China Sea, Indian Ocean and towards the Middle East and Europe. Technologically, China has developed satellites, fibre optic cables, communication networks, and has promoted the expansion of Chinese mobile companies to integrate the international community and China more deeply. The Chinese government has launched initiatives to these effects, such as developing railways in the south-east Asian region. China has also worked to influence nations through crafting aid agreements, bilateral trading agreements and establishing free trade with participating and cooperative nations. ==== All-China Journalists Association and Belt and Road ==== The All-China Journalist Association regularly cooperates with the Chinese government and member organisations and journalists to produce content that updates about and promotes the Belt and Road Project. This is exemplified through articles published by the organisation in cooperation with oligarchical Chinese news agencies such as Xinhuanet and China Daily. A report on May 5, 2020, from the organisation in collaboration with China Daily alludes to Russian collaboration through the assertion "we are all in a community of common destiny.” ==== The Belt and Road Journalists Network ==== The Belt and Road Initiative has also enabled the All-China Journalist Society, in collaboration with other members of the Belt and Road Project to create a ‘Belt and Road Journalists Network. The Belt and Road News Network, launched in 2017, encompasses 208 media organisations from over 98 different nations. The Chair of the organisation is China's People's Daily in collaboration with the All-China Journalists Association with the Secretariat located at ‘People's Daily’ in Beijing, China. The first council meeting was held in 2019, in Beijing, China, with over 40 international media organisations present. This collaboration encompasses multiple media forms, including music, photography and news. Belt and Road News Network activities include collaborative media trips, shared access to news and media archives and databases, collective workshops and training seminars, as well as awards. In September 2019, the Belt and Road News Network held a media workshop in China; over 47 countries were represented and over 100 senior correspondents and senior editors were present. ===== Belt and Road News Association Charter ===== The Charter contains 20 articles espousing collective adherence to ‘peaceful cooperation’ and ‘mutual learning.’ Article Number Summary Article 1 Jointly established by nations involved in the Belt and Road Initiative.
