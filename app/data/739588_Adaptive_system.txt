An adaptive system is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole that together are able to respond to environmental changes or changes in the interacting parts, in a way analogous to either continuous physiological homeostasis or evolutionary adaptation in biology. Feedback loops represent a key feature of adaptive systems, such as ecosystems and individual organisms; or in the human world, communities, organizations, and families. Adaptive systems can be organized into a hierarchy. Artificial adaptive systems include robots with control systems that utilize negative feedback to maintain desired states. ==The law of adaptation== The law of adaptation may be stated informally as: Formally, the law can be defined as follows: Given a system S, we say that a physical event E is a stimulus for the system S if and only if the probability P(S \rightarrow S'|E) that the system suffers a change or be perturbed (in its elements or in its processes) when the event E occurs is strictly greater than the prior probability that S suffers a change independently of E: :P(S \rightarrow S'|E)>P(S \rightarrow S') Let S be an arbitrary system subject to changes in time t and let E be an arbitrary event that is a stimulus for the system S: we say that S is an adaptive system if and only if when t tends to infinity (t\rightarrow \infty) the probability that the system S change its behavior (S\rightarrow S') in a time step t_0 given the event E is equal to the probability that the system change its behavior independently of the occurrence of the event E. In mathematical terms: #- P_{t_0}(S\rightarrow S'|E) > P_{t_0}(S\rightarrow S') > 0 #- \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} P_t(S\rightarrow S' | E) = P_t(S\rightarrow S') Thus, for each instant t will exist a temporal interval h such that: : P_{t+h}(S\rightarrow S' | E) - P_{t+h}(S\rightarrow S') < P_t(S\rightarrow S' | E) - P_t(S\rightarrow S') ==Benefit of self-adjusting systems== In an adaptive system, a parameter changes slowly and has no preferred value. In a self-adjusting system though, the parameter value “depends on the history of the system dynamics”. One of the most important qualities of self-adjusting systems is its “adaptation to the edge of chaos” or ability to avoid chaos. Practically speaking, by heading to the edge of chaos without going further, a leader may act spontaneously yet without disaster. A March/April 2009 Complexity article further explains the self-adjusting systems used and the realistic implications.Hübler, A. & Wotherspoon, T.: "Self-Adjusting Systems Avoid Chaos". Complexity. 14(4), 8 – 11. 2008 Physicists have shown that adaptation to the edge of chaos occurs in almost all systems with feedback. ==See also== * Autopoiesis * Adaptive immune system * Artificial neural network * Complex adaptive system * Diffusion of innovations * Ecosystems * Gaia hypothesis * Gene expression programming * Genetic algorithms * Learning * Neural adaptation ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== Category:Control engineering Category:Cybernetics Category:Systems theory
