American Idols Live! Tour 2005 was a summer concert tour in the United States featuring the top 10 contestants of the fourth season of American Idol, which aired in 2005. It was sponsored by Kellogg Pop-Tarts. It followed in the tradition of other American Idol summer tours following the completion of each season in May. After the poor attendance of the tour the previous year, the tour was scaled down somewhat. Forty dates were initially planned, four more dates were however later added.'American Idol' Season 4 Finalists Concert TourCarrie Underwood crowned 'American Idol,' tour launches in July An extra show was further added at the end of the tour as a benefit concert for the victims of Hurricane Katrina which struck Mississippi two weeks earlier.‘Idol’ finalists end concert tour with benefit Before the Las Vegas show, runner-up Bo Bice came down with serious stomach pains and was rushed to the hospital.

Each performer performed their own set of two to three songs to showcase their differing talent. Unlike previous years, ensemble singing was more limited. There were only a few duets in addition to the obligatory final group performance which consisted of two songs in this tour. The individual sets started off with tenth-place finisher Jessica Sierra and ending with the winner Carrie Underwood, but those in between did not performed in elimination order. The first half of the show ended with Nadia Turner's set, and the second half began with a duet between Anwar Robinson and Vonzell Solomon.American Idols Live Kickoff: One Ticket, 10 Different Concerts Bo Bice was absent throughout most of the later part of the tour due to his serious nature of his illness that required surgery, and this necessitated modifications and re-arrangement to the tour set list.
