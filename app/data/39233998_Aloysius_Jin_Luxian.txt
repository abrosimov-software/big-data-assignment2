He was orphaned as a youth, losing his mother when he was 10 and his father when he was 14. He attended Catholic schools and in 1938, at the age of 22, he entered the Society of Jesus, subsequently being ordained in 1946. He studied in France, Germany and Italy, before returning to China in 1951. He was arrested with hundreds of priests and laity in the “September 8 Incident” in 1955, a major crackdown against the “counterrevolutionary clique” of Ignatius Kung Pin-mei of Shanghai. He was subsequently released from prison in 1982 and became the founding rector of the Sheshan Major Seminary, outside of Shanghai. Bishop Jin was ordained auxiliary bishop without Vatican approval in 1985, and became diocesan bishop of Shanghai in 1988 to his death in 2013. In 2005, the Holy See eventually recognized him as Apostolic Administrator to bishop Msgr. Joseph Fan Zhongliang. == Bibliography == * == See also == * Catholic Patriotic Association * Ignatius Gong Pinmei * K. H.
