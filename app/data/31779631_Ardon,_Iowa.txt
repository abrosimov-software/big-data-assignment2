Once home to livery stables, a hotel, a railroad depot, and around 70 residents, the rail line was later moved. The railroad station was moved two miles west. Only the Ardon rail sign, St. Malachy's Catholic Church and graveyard, and a few scattered houses remain. St. Malachy's Church was constructed in 1902 next to the railroad and desanctified in 1991. The graveyard lies a half mile south of the church.Sayre, Robert F. (2000). Take the Next Exit: New Views of the Iowa Landscape, p. 102.
