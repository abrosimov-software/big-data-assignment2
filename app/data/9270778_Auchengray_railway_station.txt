Auchengray railway station was just outside Auchengray, a hamlet in the Parish of Carnwath, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It was served by local trains on what is now known as the West Coast Main Line. It is near Tarbrax and Woolfords. The Wilsontown Ironworks Branch ran from just to the north. There is now no station convenient for Auchengray. ==History== Opened by the Caledonian Railway it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923, passing on to the Scottish Region of British Railways during the nationalisation of 1948.
