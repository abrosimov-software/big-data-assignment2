The Amazon kingfisher (Chloroceryle amazona) is a species of "water kingfisher" in subfamily Cerylinae of family Alcedinidae. It is found in the lowlands of the American tropics from southern Mexico south through Central America to northern Argentina.HBW and BirdLife International (2022) Handbook of the Birds of the World and BirdLife International digital checklist of the birds of the world.

The current genus Chloroceryle was erected by Johann Jakob Kaup in 1848. The species is monotypic. ==Description== The Amazon kingfisher is about long. Males weigh and females . It has the typical kingfisher shape, with a shaggy crest and long heavy bill. The bill is black with some pale yellow at the base of the mandible and its legs and feet are dark gray. Adult males have dark bronzy green upperparts divided by a white collar. They have a white chin and throat, a rich rufous breast with dark green sides, and a white belly with dark green streaks on the side. Adult females lack the rufous breast but the green of the sides extends across the breast almost to its middle. Juvenile males have a buffy rufous breast and both sexes have buff spots on the upperwing coverts and a large yellow patch on their bill.Woodall, P. F. and G. M. Kirwan (2020).

It has been recorded as a vagrant to Aruba, Trinidad, and Texas.Remsen, J. V., Jr., J. I. Areta, E. Bonaccorso, S. Claramunt, A. Jaramillo, D. F. Lane, J. F. Pacheco, M. B. Robbins, F. G.

The Auk 2011, vol. 128(3):600-613 retrieved 9 August 2022 It inhabits large rivers, both slow- and fast-flowing, and the wooded shores of lakes and freshwater lagoons. It also occasionally occurs in brackish lagoons, mangroves, and tidal estuaries. It favors open landscapes rather than dense forest. In elevation it is mostly found below but occurs as high as in Venezuela. ==Behavior== ===Movement=== The Amazon kingfisher is generally believed to be sedentary but there are records of vagrancy. ===Feeding=== The Amazon kingfisher usually hunts from a perch from which it dives into water for its prey. Occasionally it hovers before diving. Its diet is mostly fish, especially those of family Characidae, and crustaceans. ===Breeding=== The Amazon kingfisher's breeding season varies geographically. It is generally in the first half of the year in Central America but has not been detailed elsewhere. Both members of a pair excavate a slightly inclined burrow in a river bank or similar feature; it is typically up to long and has a nest chamber at the end. The clutch size is three or four eggs. Most incubation at night is by the female and during the day by the male. The incubation period is about 22 days and fledging occurs 29 to 30 days after hatch. ===Vocalization=== The Amazon kingfisher makes a "[l]oud, harsh, repeated 'tek' or 'klek'" and a "staccato 'chrit'" that may be extended into a rattle. It also makes "frog-like" calls. Another vocalization is "an accelerating series of clear notes...'see see see...su su su su'" that is thought to be a greeting or alarm call. ==Status== The IUCN has assessed the Amazon kingfisher as being of Least Concern. It has an extremely large range. Its estimated population of at least a half million mature individuals is, however, believed to be decreasing. No immediate threats have been identified. ==References== ==External links== *Stamps (for Argentina, Guyana, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela) with RangeMap *Amazon kingfisher photo gallery VIREO Amazon kingfisher Amazon kingfisher Category:Birds of Central America Category:Birds of South America Category:Birds of Brazil Category:Birds of Colombia Category:Birds of Venezuela Category:Birds of the Amazon rainforest Category:Birds of Trinidad and Tobago Category:Birds of the Guianas Category:Birds of the Pantanal Category:Higher-level bird taxa restricted to the Neotropics Amazon kingfisher Amazon kingfisher
