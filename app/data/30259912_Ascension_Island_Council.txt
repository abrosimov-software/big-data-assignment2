The Ascension Island Council is an elected body that provides advice to the Administrator of Ascension Island on matters relating to the governance of Ascension Island. The Council is made up of either five or seven Councillors, depending on the number of candidates standing for an election, and its meetings are chaired by the Administrator. The Island's constitution requires the Governor and Administrator to consult with the Council when making laws for Ascension Island. The Governor and Administrator are not bound to accept the advice of the Council but the Council has the right of appeal to the British Government. ==Electoral system== The five (or seven) seats in the Ascension Island Council are elected for three years terms by first-past-the- post Plurality-at-large voting, with voters allowed to cast up to five (or seven) votes respectively. If there is eight or more candidates, the election will be of seven members; if there are six or seven nominations, the election will return a Council of five members. If there are fewer than six nominations, the election will be postponed for a period of up to six months, during which time there will be no Island Council.Ascension Island Government ==Council members== The current council consists of five elected members known as Councillors, who were elected in September 2019. Members of the Ascension Island Council: Andrew Robert Ellick Keturah (Kitty) Viola George Alan Herbert Nicholls Nicholas Ivan John Douglas Gordon Miller Following a further By- Election on 4 March 2021, Councillors Nicholas Ivan John and Douglas Gordon Miller joined the Island Council. ===Qualifications of Councillors=== Candidates must be 21 years of age, have British Citizenship, British Overseas Territory Citizenship or British Overseas Citizenship, must reside on the island and should have been resident on the island for the 12 months preceding nomination. In practice candidates will typically have been on the island for several years.

Consequently, a general election was called, but by the close of nominations there were only two candidates. As a result of the boycott, the election was abandoned, and the governor suspended the Island Council for 12 months. ===Third Council=== Elections to the third Council were to have taken place in April 2008 but following consultations they were delayed until October 2008. With eight nominations the elections were duly held and seven candidates were elected to form a new Island Council, which was sworn in on 28 October.See http://www.the-islander.org.ac/ ===Fourth Council=== The third Council was dissolved by the Governor in October 2010 with elections planned for 3 November 2010. By close of nominations on 19 October 2010, six nominations had been received (sufficient for elections to be held for a Council of five elected members), but two of the nominations were submitted late and therefore declared invalid.http://www.the- islander.org.ac/artd_8174_10_2010_4.html The Governor was therefore obliged to suspend the Island Government Ordinance and re-schedule the elections. On 3 February 2011, it was announced that an election would be held on 25 February.http://www.the-islander.org.ac/art_8387.htmlhttp://www.the- islander.org.ac/artd_8443_02_2011_30.html On 28 February 2011, the five new council members were sworn in by the Administrator.http://www.ascension- island.gov.ac/sites/default/files/docs/Results%20of%20General%20Election.pdf ===Fifth Council=== General elections were held on 31 October 2013.General Election 2013 - Results of Polling Day (The Islander) ===Sixth Council=== The general election was held on 1 September 2016 with six candidates running for the five seats of the Island Council.
