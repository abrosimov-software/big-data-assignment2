He lived at 15 Chanonry in Aberdeen.Aberdeen Post Office Directory 1905 In his Gifford lectures and a number of books written with his friend Patrick Geddes he argued for a form of holistic biology in which the activity of the living organism could transcend the physical laws governing its component parts.Peter J. Bowler Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth- century Britain 2001, p. 170Peter J. Bowler Science for all: the popularization of science in early twentieth-century 2009, p. 24 Some had termed the work of Geddes and Thomson as neovitalist though the position presented in their books is more closer to panpsychism as Thomson had claimed that mind can not emerge from matter and that it has existed in nature all the time. Thomson had believed there was life at all levels, he wrote that "there is nothing inanimate". He had however found the vitalist ideas of Henri Bergson inspirational.Peter J. Bowler Monkey Trials and Gorilla Sermons 2009, p. 148 According to Peter J. Bowler, Thomson was a popular science writer who had promoted a nonmaterialist interpretation of science though his interpretation was not accepted by all within the scientific community as some had claimed his views were neovitalist and thus outdated.David M.
