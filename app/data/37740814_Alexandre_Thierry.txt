This was considered his greatest work, an organ with 39 stops and four manuals, the first organ with four manuals in Paris. From 1680 to 1687, thanks to the protection of the king's organists Nicolas Lebègue and Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers, Alexandre Thierry maintained and improved the Royal positive organs at the Palace of Versailles, Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Palace of Fontainebleau and Saint-Cyr. He was responsible for the organ in the royal chapel of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
