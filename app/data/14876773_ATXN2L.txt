Ataxin-2-like protein was initially identified in 1996 and designated Ataxin-2 Related protein (A2RP) as the search for the gene causing SCA2 lead to the identification of 2 cDNA clones with high similarity to ATXN2 (Pulst et al, 1996). It was later renamed as ATXN2L. It is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ATXN2L gene. This gene encodes an ataxin type 2 related protein of unknown function. This protein is a member of the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCAs) family, which is associated with a complex group of neurodegenerative disorders. Several alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. ==Interactions== ATXN2L has been shown to interact with Myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene. ==References== * ==External links== * ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * * * *
