Angermünde () is a town in the district of Uckermark in the state of Brandenburg, Germany. It is about northeast of Berlin, the capital of Germany. The population is about 14,000, but has been declining since its traditional industrial base, enamel-working, has declined. An administrative sub-centre of its district, it has several Protestant churches, a former Franciscan church, a number of schools of higher learning and a recently refurbished historic marketplace with an old town hall. Located in the game-filled forests of the Uckermark, with its many lakes, it now relies heavily on tourism and the sources of revenue linked to it. Since 2010, Angermünde is a federally declared resort town. ==Name== The name Angermünde is an abbreviation of the older town of Tangermünde, for a while the town was named New-Tangermünde (Neu-Tangermünde), until it was changed to "Angermünde", with Anger being German for a central square in a town. == Geography == Angermünde is located in the Uckermarck region, roughly 80 km north of Berlin.

In the 19th century, the town was the seat of a Prussian circle in the province of Brandenburg and linked to Berlin by the Berlin–Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland) railway. Angermünde station then served as the junction for branch lines servicing Prenzlau, Bad Freienwalde, and Schwedt. == Demography == File:Bevölkerungsentwicklung Angermünde.pdf|Development of population since 1875 within the current Boundaries (Blue Line: Population; Dotted Line: Comparison to Population development in Brandenburg state; Grey Background: Time of Nazi Germany; Red Background: Time of communist East Germany) File:Bevölkerungsprognosen Angermünde.pdf|Recent Population Development and Projections (Population Development before Census 2011 (blue line); Recent Population Development according to the Census in Germany in 2011 (blue bordered line); Official projections for 2005-2030 (yellow line); for 2017-2030 (scarlet line); for 2020-2030 (green line) ==Mayors== * 1989–1998: Wolf-Hugo Just * 1998–2016: Wolfgang Krakow (SPD) * since 2016: Frederik Bewer (independent) Frederik Bewer was elected in May 2016 with 95.3% of the vote, for an eight-year term.Ergebnis der Bürgermeisterstichwahl am 8.
