The Anti-Spyware Coalition (ASC) was a group formed in 2005 with the goal to build a consensus about definitions and best practices in the debate surrounding spyware. Composed of anti-spyware software companies, academics, and consumer groups, the ASC seeks to bring together a diverse array of perspective on the problem of controlling spyware and other potentially unwanted technologies. ==History== Formed in 2005 after the dissolution of the Consortium of Anti-Spyware Technology Vendors (COAST) which broke up over internal dissent.Cowley, Stacy, "Coast antispyware consortium falls apart", IDG News Service, http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/02/08/HNcoastfallsapart_1.html February 8, 2005 In April 2005 Ari Schwartz called together the initial group of Anti- Spyware companies; others later joined. A series of documents was published, and feedback solicited. The first set of documents consisted of a definition of spyware and potentially unwanted technologies, and a vendor dispute resolution process. This was followed by a "Risk Model" providing Anti-Spyware vendors with a framework for classifying software. In March 2007 the ASC published the public final draft of their Best Practices document. ==References== ==External links== *Anti-spyware guidelines get final version Category:Spyware
