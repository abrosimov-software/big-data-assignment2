Adore Life is the second studio album by the English post-punk band Savages, released on 22 January 2016. The album was also nominated for the 2016 Mercury Prize, the band's second consecutive nomination after Silence Yourself was nominated for the prize in 2013. ==Music and style== Adore Life drew comparison once again to Siouxsie Sioux. Financial Times wrote: "Beth sings with imposing control: even the words she utters with a wild yelp, à la Siouxsie Sioux, seem purposely unleashed". Critic Ludovic Hunter-Tilney described the music as, "Distorted guitars set up flayed layers of sound, backed by sinewy drums and bass". ==Critical reception== Adore Life received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 82, based on 33 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". In a favourable review, Paste said that Adore Life was still inspired by Savages' first influences while adding, it "builds on that sound, and frames it in a contemporary context that is less throwback than thrilling". In a 3.5 out of 5 review, Rolling Stone wrote that "their music is driven by emotions that are almost unprecedented in the [post-punk] genre". ===Accolades=== Publication Accolade Year Rank American Songwriter Top 50 Albums of 2016 2016 Consequence of Sound Top 50 Albums of 2016 2016 NME NME's Albums of the Year 2016 2016 Pitchfork The 20 Best Rock Albums of 2016 2016 Rough Trade Albums of the Year 2016 The Skinny Top 50 Albums of 2016 2016 ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Savages * Jehnny Beth – vocals * Gemma Thompson – guitar * Ayse Hassan – bass guitar * Fay Milton – drums Technical * Johnny Hostile – production * Trentemøller – mixing * John Davis – mastering * Richard Woodcraft – engineering Artwork * Craig Ward – design, logo ==Chart positions== Chart (2016) Peak position UK Albums Chart 26 US Billboard 200 99 US Alternative Albums (Billboard) 5 US Independent Albums (Billboard) 3 US Top Rock Albums (Billboard) 6 ==References== Category:2016 albums Category:Matador Records albums Category:Savages (band) albums
