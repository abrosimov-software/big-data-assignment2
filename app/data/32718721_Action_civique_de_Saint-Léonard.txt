Action civique de Saint-Léonard was a municipal political party that existed from 1984 to 1986 in the suburban community of Saint-Leonard in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The party claimed more than five hundred members in March 1986 and held one seat on the Saint-Leonard city council.Debbie Parkes, "Opposition candidates reject new St. Leonard political party," Montreal Gazette, 27 March 1986, X9. The party emerged from a split in the governing Équipe du renouveau de la cité de Saint-Léonard party the followed mayor Antonio di Ciocco's death in July 1984. Domenico Moschella formed Action civique, while his leadership rival Raymond Renaud formed the Ralliement de Saint-Léonard. Renaud defeated Moschella in a mayoral by-election later in the year and was able to form a new municipal administration.Debbie Parkes, "St. Leonard party unites defectors and former rivals," Montreal Gazette, 9 October 1988, X8. In the aftermath of this political restructuring, Moschella was only city councillor to serve with the Action civique party.Barry Kliff, "Two St. Leonard councillors quit to organize new opposition party," Montreal Gazette, 17 July 1985, X1.
