The Association of Gardeners, Settlers, and Animal Breeders was a mass organization of the German Democratic Republic from 1959 until shortly after German reunification in 1990. The association worked to assist and improve the economic stances of allotment gardeners and small animal breeders, such as dogs and goats.Meyers Universallexikon in vier BÃ¤nden, Band IV, VEB Bibliographisches Institut Leipzig, 1980, Lizenz-Nr. 433130/90/80, S. 44. Initially founded in 1953, its creation was rejected by the ruling Socialist Unity Party, and it took another six years for the organization to be officially consecrated. In 1988, the association had over 1.5 million members, and it was officially dissolved on December 31, 1990, two months after reunification. ==See also== *National Front (East Germany) *Peasants Mutual Aid Association ==References== Category:Organisations based in East Germany Category:Mass organisations of East Germany Category:1950s establishments in Germany Category:1990s disestablishments in Germany
