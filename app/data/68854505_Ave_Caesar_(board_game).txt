Ave Caesar is a board game published in 1989 by Ravensburger. ==Contents== Ave Caesar is a game in which a three lap chariot race involves playing cards and moving the distance. ==Reception== Brian Walker reviewed Ave Caesar for Games International magazine, and gave it 2 stars out of 5, and stated that "Our normal definition for a two star rating is 'only if you are interested in the subject'. In this case modify that to read: 'only if you have designed a similar game yourself and are looking for some decent components'." ==Reviews== *Jeux & Strat√©gie #58https://archive.org/details/jeux-et- strategie-58/page/16/mode/2up ==References== Category:Board games introduced in 1989 Category:Ravensburger games
