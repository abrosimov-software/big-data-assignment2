He argued that capitalism was inherently violent as it rested upon servitude and poverty through debt. He argued in favour of emancipation from the "passive revolution" of globalised capitalism through resistance, or the advocacy of workers rights, feminism, postcolonialism, multiculturalism, and the rejection of neo-colonialism. According to philosopher Yvon Quiniou, Tosel played a critical role in disseminating Marxist theories in academic circles. ==Personal life, death and tributes== Tosel was married with children.

On his death, Patrick Le Hyaric, the editor-in-chief of L'Humanité, said he was "overwhelmed with sadness" and said Tosel was "like a shining light, a touchstone in this world of ideological counter-punch where everything is hidden by powerful forces who want to take over the entirety of thought and culture." Pierre Laurent, the chairman of the French Communist Party, said he was "very moved" by his death, and he added that Tosel had "a deep understanding of the difficulties faced by progressive forces and a willingness to exchange ideas and share his analyses and convictions, not only with a learned audience, but most importantly with young people and workers." ==Works== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==References== Category:1941 births Category:2017 deaths Category:People from Nice Category:École Normale Supérieure alumni Category:Academic staff of the University of Franche-Comté Category:Academic staff of the University of Paris Category:Academic staff of Côte d'Azur University Category:20th-century French philosophers Category:21st-century French philosophers Category:French Marxists Category:Marxist theorists Category:French Communist Party members Category:Spinoza scholars
