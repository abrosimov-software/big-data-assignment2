Applewood, or Applewood smoked cheddar, is a round, white smoke-flavoured Cheddar cheese that is manufactured by Norseland Limited (formerly Ilchester Cheese Company) in Somerset, England. ==Character== Applewood smoked cheddar is a fairly dense semi-hard cheese. Applewood is not smoked, but is instead treated with an artificial smoke flavouring. The cheese is coated with mild paprika, giving it a golden-amber appearance. The cheese itself is rather soft in some cases, making it difficult to grate. The smoked flavour of the cheese does not leave a burnt aftertaste. In 2019, Norseland Limited launched a vegan version of their Applewood cheese in collaboration with VBites in both pre- sliced packages and in blocks. It won the award for Best Vegan Cheese at the FreeFrom Food Awards in 2020. ==Nutritional data (per oz.)== (Note: one ounce is about 28 grams) Calories 130 Total Fat 11 g Saturated fat 7 g Trans fat 0 g Cholesterol 37 mg Sodium 213 mg Total Carbohydrate 0 g Dietary fibre 0 g Protein 8 g ==References== ==External links== *Norseland Homepage Category:English cheeses Category:Cow's-milk cheeses
