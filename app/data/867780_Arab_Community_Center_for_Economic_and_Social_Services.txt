The Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services (ACCESS) is a human services organization committed to the development of the Arab American community. ACCESS helps low-income families, as well as newly arrived immigrants adapt to life in the United States. Its goal is to foster a greater understanding of Arab culture in the U.S. and in the Arab world. ACCESS provides social, mental health, educational, artistic, employment, legal, and medical services. ==History== ACCESS began operating out of a storefront at Dearborn’s South End in 1971. Staffed by volunteers, ACCESS’ first board president was George Khoury, accompanied by Hajjah Aliya Hassan as the first volunteer director. Without the help of The Association of Arab-American University Graduates (AAUG), and its donation of the first months rent, the opening of ACCESS on Vernor Highway would not have been possible. In subsequent years, ACCESS moved to Hashemite Hall until it burned down. In 1973, the building on Saulino Court was purchased by the Yemeni Benevolent Association, and offered to ACCESS free of charge, where the administrative offices still reside today. The expansion of ACCESS has grown to five locations, including the Arab American National Museum (AANM), which was founded on May 5, 2005. ==Social Services== With two walk-in offices in Dearborn and one outreach office in Hamtramck, Social Services continues to assist the community.
