Aphelenchoides is a genus of mycetophagous nematodes. Some species are plant pathogenic foliar nematodes. == Taxonomy == In 1961 Sanwal listed 33 species and provided a key. The most important species of these are Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi, the chrysanthemum foliar nematode; Aphelenchoides fragariae, the spring crimp or spring dwarf nematode of strawberry, which also attacks many ornamentals; and Aphelenchoides besseyi, causing summer crimp or dwarf of strawberry and white tip of rice. Several species of this genus feed ectoparasitically and endoparasitically on aboveground plant parts. == References == == Bibliography == * George Agrios (2005): Plant Pathology, Fifth Edition.
