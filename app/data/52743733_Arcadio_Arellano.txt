Arcadio Arellano (13 November 1872 – 20 April 1920) was a notable architect who was considered a pioneer during his time. He built famous edifices and the residential buildings of the elite. In all his works, he departed from American and European designs and instead incorporated Filipino native plants and motifs. ==Early life and education== Arellano was born on 13 November 1872 in Tondo, Manila. He was the third child in a brood of fifteen children. His father, Luis Arellano, was a native of Bulakan, Bulacan and was a builder himself. The older Arellano built the Franciscan Church at Pinaglabanan, San Juan, and was also a consultant to Don Juan Hervas, the Spanish consulting architect, from 1887 to 1883. Arellano's mother was Bartola de Guzman. One of his uncles was Deodato Arellano, the propagandist and first president of the Katipunan. He acquired his elementary education from schools in Tondo.

He was responsible for supervising the repairs made to the Malolos Convent in 1898.

By 1901, he became technical director of general assessment for the whole city. He was also able to work closely with Governor W. H. Taft as his private consulting architect. On 15 February 1907, he represented the district of Santa Cruz in the advisory board of Manila, holding the position until 1 July 1908.
