Somashekharayya is a Municipal Counselor and is a very greedy man. As he does not get any dowry, he and his wife become quite upset, though Ravi is happy. Both want Ravi to remarry so that they can get dowry. Meanwhile, Gayathri becomes pregnant and so the in-laws try to eliminate her at the earliest. Somashekharayya gets Ravi transferred to another city. After sending him away, Somashekharayya plans to kill Gayathri in a fashion similar to an accident. But things did not turn up as he expected and his wife gets badly burned, who has to be hospitalized. Taking this opportunity, Somashekharayya blames Gayathri for attempting to kill Savitri and has her arrested. Finally, Vishwanath gives the dowry by taking debt to Somashekharayya and beats him very badly, when Ravi leaves the house making a cut with his father, which makes him remorseful after seeing all this and asks for Gayathri's forgiveness. Gayathri, who has just given birth to a baby boy forgives him.
