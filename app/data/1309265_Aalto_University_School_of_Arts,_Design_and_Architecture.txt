Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture; ; ), was formed of two separate schools: the faculty of architecture (previously part of the Helsinki University of Technology) and the University of Art and Design Helsinki (UIAH, known in Finnish as TaiK). TaiK, founded in 1871, was the largest art university in the Nordic countries. The university awards the following academic degrees: Bachelor of Science in Technology, Architect, Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Doctor of Arts. The university is known for its research projects and industrial collaborations. During the rectorship of Yrjö Sotamaa the university was active in integrating design into Finnish innovation and business networks. This eventually led to the decision to merge TaiK together with Helsinki University of Technology (TKK) and the Helsinki School of Economics (HSE) into a new charter university, Aalto University, which started in January 2010. In the global QS World University Rankings in 2021, the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture was placed 6th in the art and design subject area. In the field of architecture & built environment Aalto was ranked 42nd. Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture is a founding member of the Cumulus Association, a global association of higher education institutions in the fields of art, design and media. == Organization == Degree programmes are organized under five departments: * Department of Architecture * Department of Art * Department of Design * Department of Film, Television and Scenography * Department of Media, including the Aalto Media Lab == Notable alumni == The school in its earlier incarnation as Taik educated many of the household names of Finnish art, design and cinema.
