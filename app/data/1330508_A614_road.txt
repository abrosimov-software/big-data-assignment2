From here, the road becomes a trunk road running through the settlements of Howden, Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, Driffield, ending on the Yorkshire coast at Bridlington, where it joins the A165. ==History== ===Former route in Nottinghamshire=== The road used to continue south from the junction with the A60, next to the Little Chef, and overlap the A60. The north-west section of the Nottingham western bypass, up to the A52 junction, near the Queen's Medical Centre (before the Clifton Boulevard was built) was the A614 for some time and is now the A6514. Before renumbering of Clifton Boulevard to the A52, concurrent with the numbering of the A614 to A6514, the section from the A52 to A606 was also A614. ===Former route in the East Riding of Yorkshire=== Originally, the A614 went from Thorne via Snaith to Selby. The current section from Goole through Rawcliffe was the A161 (from Gainsborough). From Goole to Holme-on-Spalding Moor, it was the A1041. From here through Market Weighton, to Driffield, it was the A163. From here to Bridlington, it used to be the A166 (which is the road from York). More recently, it finished at Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, then what is now the A614, carried on north as the A163 (from Selby), then as the A164 (from Beverley) just before Driffield. ===Fatal accident in February 2009=== On Friday, 13 February 2009 just after 23:00 six people were killed in a head-on collision on the road in Nottinghamshire between the Bilsthorpe crossroads and the Eakring turn-off. The victims were four teenagers in one car, and an elderly couple in the other. The cause of the accident was concluded by the coroner as to have happened as a result of "inappropriate overtaking" by the driver of the teenagers' car. ==References== ==External links== * Improvements to Apleyhead junction. * SABRE Category:Roads in England Category:Roads in Yorkshire Category:Transport in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Transport in Nottinghamshire Category:Transport in South Yorkshire
