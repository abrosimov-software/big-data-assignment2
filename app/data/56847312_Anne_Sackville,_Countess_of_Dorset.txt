History of Parliament Online - Compton, Henry Anne's second husband died in 1589. A revised version of Edmund Spenser's poem, "Mother Hubberd's Tale", published in 1590, was dedicated to Anne as "the Lady Compton and Mountegle". Anne married the future earl on 4 December 1592, a year after the death of his first wife, the former Lady Margaret Howard. Whereas his first marriage had been a happy one, he described his second wife in his will as one "whom without great grief and sorrow inconsolable I cannot remember, in regard of her exceeding unkindness and intolerable evil usage towards myself and my late good lord and father deceased". Dorset complained about his second wife's "misconduct", and was considering a separation from her at the time of his death in 1609. However, Cecily, one of his daughters from his first marriage, married his stepson Henry Compton, by whom she had three children.G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H.
