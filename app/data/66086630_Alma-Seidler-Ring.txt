The Alma-Seidler-Ring was created in 1978 by the Austrian government as the female counterpart of the Iffland-Ring. Similar to that ring, the holder, or bearer, of the Alma-Seidler-Ring is considered to be the "most significant and most worthy actress of the German-speaking theatre", in the opinion of the previous holder who has passed it to her by will. The ring is named after the Austrian actress Alma Seidler (1899–1977). According to the widow of Werner Krauss, holder of the Iffland-Ring from 1954 to 1959, he would have preferred to pass the ring to Seidler, had tradition not prevented him from willing it to a woman. == Bearers of the Alma-Seidler-Ring == Ring-Bearer Born Died Duration Nationality Paula Wessely 20 January 1907 11 May 2000 1979–2000 Austrian Annemarie Düringer 26 November 1925 26 November 2014 2000–2014 Swiss Regina Fritsch 1964 Since 2014 Austrian == References == == Further reading == * Bernhard A.
