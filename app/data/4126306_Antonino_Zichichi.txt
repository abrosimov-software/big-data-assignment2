He has served as President of the World Federation of Scientists, as a professor at the University of Bologna, and is associated with American conservative think- tank the Heartland Institute. ==Biography== Zichichi was born in Trapani, Sicily, in 1929. He has collaborated on several discoveries in the field of sub-nuclear physics and has worked in numerous research laboratories such as Fermilab in Chicago and CERN in Geneva. In 1963, he founded the Centro Ettore Majorana of Erice, dedicated to scientific culture. The Ettore Majorana centre sponsors the International School of Subnuclear Physics, where Zichichi serves as director. He was president of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare from 1977 up to 1982 and in 1980 he strongly backed the creation of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. Currently, he is an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Bologna. He is president of the World Federation of Scientists, an organization concerned with the fight against planetary emergencies. He was one of the creators of Erice statement. ==Honors and assignments== *Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic *Order of Merit of the Italian Republic *Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic *President of European Physical Society (1978-1980) *President of Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics (1977-1982) *President of Commission OTAN of Technologies for Disarmament *Representative of EEC in the Scientific Committee of the International Centre for Science and Technology in Moscow *President of Historical Museum of Physics and Research Centre "E.
