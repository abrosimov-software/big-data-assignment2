Study of this fungus in the Amazon rainforest showed that on average, these cups hold 35 millitres of water, in addition to organic matter such as leaves, flowers and fruits that fall from trees; this provides an ideal environment for various insect species (especially filter-feeding species like mosquitoes) to breed. ==References== Category:Taxa described in 1965 Category:Monotypic Polyporales genera Category:Meruliaceae Category:Taxa named by Derek Reid
