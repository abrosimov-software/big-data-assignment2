He served as mayor of Arad for twenty years. In addition to his mayoral duties he was deputy chairman of the Union of Local Authorities, chairman of the Development Towns Committee of the Union of Local Authorities. In the 1984 Knesset elections he was on the Alignment's Knesset list, but failed to win a seat. However, when Aharon Harel resigned from the Knesset in May 1988, Shochat replaced him. He retained his seat in elections in November that year, and became chairman of the Finance Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee. After being re-elected in 1992 (by which time the Alignment had become the Labour Party), he was appointed Minister of Finance by Yitzhak Rabin. Although he was re-elected again in 1996, the opposition Likud won the election and Shochat lost his ministerial position. Following victory for Ehud Barak and One Israel (an alliance of Labour, Meimad and Gesher) in 1999, Shochat was once again appointed Minister of Finance. In October 2000 he was also made Minister of National Infrastructure replacing Eliyahu Swisa after Shas left Barak's coalition. After Ariel Sharon won special elections for Prime Minister in 2001, Shochat left the cabinet. In the 2003 elections he also lost his Knesset seat. After leaving the Knesset, Shochat was commissioned to produce a report on tuition fees for Israeli university students. His report, published in July 2007, recommended raising fees for Bachelor's degrees by 70% and increasing government funding for higher education by NIS 1.5 billion.Shochat: University tuition hike will help reverse brain drain Haaretz, 16 July 2007 ==References== ==External links== * *Avraham Shochat Jewish Virtual Library Category:1936 births Category:Israeli engineers Category:Eshkol family Category:Mayors of places in Israel Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Tel Aviv Category:Alignment (Israel) politicians Category:Israeli Labor Party politicians Category:One Israel politicians Category:Technion – Israel Institute of Technology alumni Category:Ministers of Finance of Israel Category:Members of the 11th Knesset (1984–1988) Category:Members of the 12th Knesset (1988–1992) Category:Members of the 13th Knesset (1992–1996) Category:Members of the 14th Knesset (1996–1999) Category:Members of the 15th Knesset (1999–2003) Category:Members of the 16th Knesset (2003–2006) Category:People from Arad, Israel
