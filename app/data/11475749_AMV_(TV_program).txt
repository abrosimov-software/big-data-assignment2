AMV (All Music Video) was a music video show broadcast by the Seven Network between 2000 and 2002. It aired between 7.30am and 9am every weekday, following the 90 minute-long Sunrise news bulletin. It was cancelled in February 2002 when Sunrise expanded into a three-hour-long (later three-and-a- half-hour) format. AMV was similar to the long-running ABC1 music show rage in that it featured no host, and Network Ten's Video Hits in that it aired a combination of new and popular clips. However, due to the early morning timeslot (which competed against children's programming such as Cheez TV), content was often censored; for example upon broadcasting the controversial video for Robbie Williams' "Rock DJ", the infamous gory ending was not shown. ==See also== * List of Australian music television shows Category:2000 Australian television series debuts Category:2002 Australian television series endings Category:Australian music chart television shows Category:Australian music television series Category:Seven Network original programming
