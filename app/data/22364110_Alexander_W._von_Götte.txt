Alexander Wilhelm Götte (December 31, 1840 - February 5, 1922), best known as Alexander Goette was a German zoologist born in St. Petersburg. He is remembered for his studies involving the biological development of various animals. The invertebrate species Opisthocystis goettei (Bresslau, 1906) is named after him.Biographical Etymology of Marine Organism Names.
