Antonio Esparragoza Betancourt (born 2 September 1959) is a Venezuelan former boxer who is a former WBA Featherweight Champion of the World. == Amateur career == Esparragoza represented Venezuela as a Featherweight at the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games. Below are the results from that tournament: * Round of 64: bye * Round of 32: lost to Peter Hanlon (Great Britain) by decision, 1-4 == Professional career == Esparragoza turned pro in 1981 and after largely fighting unproven fighters in his native Venezuela was granted a shot at Lineal & WBA Featherweight Titles holder Steve Cruz in 1987. Esparragoza pulled off an upset with a TKO in the 12th round. Esparragoza defended the titles against seven contenders before losing the belts to Yong-Kyun Park in 1991 via unanimous decision. He retired after the loss. Due to his incredible knockout power, Esparragoza is ranked at 75 in Ring Magazine's list of 100 Greatest Punchers. ==Professional boxing record== Result Record Opponent Type Round, time Date Location Notes 36 Loss 30–2–4 Park Yong-kyun UD 12 Mar 30, 1991 35 Win 30–1–4 Chan Mok Park UD 12 May 12, 1990 34 Win 29–1–4 Eduardo Montoya KO 5 (12), Sep 22, 1989 33 Win 28–1–4 Jean Marc Renard KO 6 (12), Jun 2, 1989 32 Win 27–1–4 Mitsuru Sugiya KO 10 (12), Mar 26, 1989 31 Win 26–1–4 Jose Marmolejo KO 8 (12), Nov 5, 1988 30 Draw 25–1–4 Marcos Villasana 12 Jun 23, 1988 29 Win 25–1–3 Pascual Aranda KO 10 (12), Jul 26, 1987 28 Win 24–1–3 Steve Cruz TKO 12 (12), Mar 6, 1987 27 Win 23–1–3 Octavio Quinones RTD 3 (10), Jan 16, 1987 26 Draw 22–1–3 Nelson Rodriguez PTS 10 May 19, 1986 25 Win 22–1–2 Bernardo Checa KO 2 (10) Mar 22, 1986 24 Win 21–1–2 Jose M.
