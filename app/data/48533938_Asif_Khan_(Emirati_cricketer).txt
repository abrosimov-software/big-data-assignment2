Between 2007 and 2014, Asif played domestic cricket in Pakistan, including 32 first-class matches for Lahore.

He made his ODI debut on 5 March 2022, for the UAE against Oman. On 16 March 2023, in a match against Nepal, Khan scored his first century in ODIs. Khan's century came off in 41 balls, which was the quickest hundred by a player from an associate nation, and fourth quickest overall, in terms of number of balls played in an ODI. In the same month, he brought up his second ODI century, scoring career-best 103 runs off 84 balls, against the United States in the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier Play-off. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Emirati cricketers Category:United Arab Emirates One Day International cricketers Category:Pakistani cricketers Category:Lahore cricketers Category:Cricketers from Lahore Category:Pakistani emigrants to the United Arab Emirates Category:Pakistani expatriate sportspeople in the United Arab Emirates
