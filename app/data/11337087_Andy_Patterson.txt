Over five years later when he was 11 years old in late February 1975 was the true start. His father had brought him a Dan Gurney monoshock bicycle for Christmas. Approximately two months later he found a track while riding in his bike in Little Lake Park in Norwalk, California. He told his father and he started taking Andy racing.BMX Plus!

December 1983 Vol.6 No.12 pg.36 (race results) In the Pro class he raced against Senior pros like Clint Miller. There was no "B" pro or Superclass category at the time. However, this probably didn't count since upon return to the United States he returned to racing in the junior pro class. There his first Senior Pro race was the 1984 ABA Supernationals in late January. He did not make the main. First Senior pro win: Height and weight at height of his career (1981–1984): Ht:6'3" Wt:185 lbs. Retired: Faded out after the 1986 season. He raced a few times after that but not seriously, similar to Stu Thomsen's once or twice a year pro races at nationals after he officially retired early in the 1987 season. In 1990 Andy Patterson had him reclassified as a single "A" junior pro with the ABA and raced the ABA U.S Nationals in Lemoore, California, on April 21, 1990. He wonBMX Plus!

He raced for GT on the December 10 & 11 then showed up and raced for Skyway on the 12th.Bicycle Motocross Action March 1982 Vol.7 No.3 pg.77&78 ====Professional==== *Skyway Recreations: December 12, 1981-June 1984. Andy Patterson left Skyway because Skyway wanted him to continue doing European racing circuit tours and promotionals. Patterson for his part felt like he was missing out on the big money races and the high competition level of the American racers. The lack of coverage of European races by the BMX press in the United States was another factor. According to Patterson, lack of coverage lead to the perception by American readers that he was out of BMX. Patterson felt out of touch due to this and wanted to return to the American circuit.BMX Plus!

The starting gate slammed down onto it. It happened approximately five weeks after he won the European Open Championship in France in June 1983.Super BMX May 1984 Vol.11 No.5 pg.59 He was laid up for approximately three months.BMX Plus! January 1984 Vol.7 No.1 pg.68 ===Racing habits and traits=== *One of the few top BMX racers to stick to the outmoded one pedal start well into the 1980s. He couldn't ever get used to doing the balance two pedal start that became standard in the early 1980s. He just felt more comfortable with the one pedal start and felt if he was able to time the gate correctly he could get out of the gate faster than anyone else, including those who used two pedal starts.BMX Plus! September 1982 Vol.5 No.9 pg.47 One pedal starts involved rearing back with your arms straight out and almost parallel to the ground with one foot behind and to aside the rear wheel. The other foot was on a pedal that was extended forward and the front tire pushing against the starting gate. When the gate dropped a rider would lunge forward placing his weight on the lead pedal, accelerating him out of the gate. If timed right with a quick reaction a racer can get a jump on the others out of the gate called the holeshot. By the early 1980s two pedal starts became the mode in which the vast majority of top racers used. It was almost exactly identical to the one pedal start except the trailing foot was on the trailing pedal as with the leading foot was on the leading pedal. The racer maintained his balance with the friction of the front tire pressed against the gate and the racer subtlety shifting his weight to counteract the imbalance. Getting out of the gate was similar to the one pedal start in that the racer lunged his weight forward against the handle bars while pressing his full weight and leg strength against the lead pedal. Simultaneously you use your upper body strength to quickly pull the bike forward with the handle bars. By the early 1980s most racers felt that this provided a quicker start to the old one pedal start with the advantage of not having to find the rear pedal with trailing foot. Since it is already on the pedal you can concentrate fully on starting and getting out of the gate a second sooner than anyone using a one pedal start technique. Ironically, the sanctioning bodies in the early 80's to cut down on gate jumping by those using the two pedal start who could time the cadence of the gate lights because it fell at a set period of time every time (they use starting lights much like those on a top fuel drag racing drag strip). In 1985 the ABA switched to dead man gates in which the green light didn't light and the gate fall in a predictable fashion making timing the gate difficult (the gate still fell the instant the light turned green of course). Concentrating on when the light turn green was critical with reaction time to that was critical. This made two pedal starts even more of a premium, making one pedal starts unheard off by the mid to late 1980s. *He never won a Senior pro Main at a national with any American sanctioning body. ===Miscellaneous and trivia=== *Andy Patterson is NOT related to the BMX racing brother combination of Brent & Brian Patterson.BMX Plus! February 1982 Vol.5 No.2 pg.28 *He was also a competent freestyle rider practicing flatland and bowl riding routines and maneuvers. He belonged to an informal trick teem called Freestyle Force. However, he viewed himself primarily as racer and not a freestyle rider to the extent of him turning down offers from companies like Pepsi Cola to put on demonstration shows with his trick team.
