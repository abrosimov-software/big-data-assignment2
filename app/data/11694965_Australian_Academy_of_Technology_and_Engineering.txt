The Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering (ATSE) is a learned academy that helps Australians understand and use technology to solve complex problems. It was founded in 1975 as one of Australia's then four learned academies (now five). Its original name was the 'Australian Academy of Technological Sciences', but in 1987 the name was lengthened to include Engineering, as 'Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering'. In 2015, the Academy adopted a new business name, the 'Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering', reserving the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering as its company name. The Academy operates as an independent, non-government, not-for-profit, chartered organisation. ==Organisation== ATSE is composed of nearly 900 Fellows, bringing together Australia’s leading experts in applied science, technology and engineering to provide impartial, practical and evidence-based advice on how to achieve sustainable solutions and advance prosperity. The Academy Governance structure consists of a Board, an Assembly (strategic advisory body), a number of Board Committees, policy-generating Forums, state and territory-based Divisions, and a professional Secretariat. ===List of presidents=== *Sir Ian McLennan : 1975–1983 * Sir David Zeidler : 1984–1988 * Sir Rupert Myers : 1989–1994 * Sir Arvi Parbo : 1995–1997 * Mr M A (Tim) Besley : 1998–2002 * Professor John Zillman : 2003–2006 *Professor Robin Batterham : 2007–2012 *Dr Alan Finkel : 2013–2015 * Professor Peter Gray : 2015–2016 * Professor Hugh Bradlow : 2016–2022 * Dr Katherine Woodthorpe : 2022–present ==Fellowship== ===Royal Fellow=== The Academy inducted its Royal Fellow, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh KG KT OM GBE AK PC FRS FAA FTSE, in 1977. ===Foundation Fellows=== Foundation Fellows include: *Prof Graeme Bird *Dr John Christian *Dr Bob Durie *Dr Keith Farrer *Dr John Gladstones *Em Prof Antoni Karbowiak *Dr Philip Law *Prof Alec Lazenby *Sir Ian McLennan – Foundation President *Dr Robert Muncey *Sir Mark Oliphant *Prof June Olley *Prof David Solomon *Sir James Vernon *Dr Bob Ward *Prof Howard Worner ===Honorary Fellows=== Honorary Fellows include: *Elizabeth Broderick AO, a former Sex Discrimination Commissioner *Dame Marie Bashir AD, the former Governor of NSW *Tim Andrew Fischer AC, the former Deputy Prime Minister *John Landy AC, the former Olympian and Governor of Victoria *David Hurley, AC DSC, Governor-General of Australia, the former Governor of NSW === Fellows === ==Clunies-Ross Award== Founded in 1959 to perpetuate the memory of Sir Ian Clunies Ross, the Ian Clunies Ross Memorial Foundation promoted the development of science and technology in Australia's beneficial interest.
