Afrokuom District is one of the forty-three districts in Ashanti Region, Ghana. Originally it was formerly part of the then-larger Adansi South District on 17 February 2004, until the western part of the district was split off to create Afrokuom District on 15 March 2018; thus the remaining part has been retained as Adansi South District. The district assembly is located in the southern part of Ashanti Region and has Akrofuom as its capital town. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:Districts of Ashanti Region Category:Populated places in Ghana
