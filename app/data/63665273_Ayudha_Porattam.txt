A few more misadventures such as this, rather than resurrecting the heroâ€™s dipping career, will, on the contrary, make it non- existent". Sify gave a similar review and stated that " The basic premise of the story is interesting, but the screenplay and characters are half-baked". === Box office === The film was a dud at the Chennai box office. == References == Category:Indian action drama films Category:Films set in Sri Lanka Category:2011 action drama films Category:2011 films Category:2010s Tamil- language films
