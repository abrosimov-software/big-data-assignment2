Anwar is researching ancient Hindu Temples. The family rents out a room to a poor widow and her attractive daughter, Mehru, whom Anwar falls in love with. Anwar is certain of Mehru's love for him, but Mehru has her heart set on settling in America. She is tired of the dust, the summer heat, and the struggles and tragedy of her poverty-stricken country. Anwar tells Mehru it is not possible for him to take her to the U.S. Even if he works all day, it is impossible and out of his reach. Mehru expresses her interest in Udit, an engineer that has plans to settle in America. Mehru begins a relationship with Udit, which one day is revealed to Anwar. One day Anwar visits Udit who tells him of his plan to marry Mehru before going to the USA as his visa is ready. Anwar tells him that he should think once again before doing this because of the differences in religion, as Mehru is a follower of Islam and Udit is a follower of Hinduism. If Mehru's strict and conservative family members come to know about this, they will shatter the dreams of Mehru and Udit and even their life will not be spared. Seeing that Udit has ignored his warning, Anwar confesses his feelings to Mehru when they meet on the terrace and he begs her not to leave him. He cannot imagine his life without her, but Mehru says that she never loved Anwar. Mehru runs away with Udit. Later, seeing Mehru's mother cry her heart out for her daughter, Anwar out of impulsiveness tells her and the family that she has run away with a Hindu man. Mehru's uncle along with 2 other men finds the two, shoots Udit, and brings the injured Mehru back home. Mehru commits suicide at the tragedy of Udit's death. A guilt-ridden Anwar takes shelter in an ancient Hindu temple in Dholpur carrying a bag containing drawings of mandirs and notes on Lord Krishna, Devi Meera, and Mehru. This bag ends up with the police, who come to the conclusion that Anwar is a terrorist who is planning to detonate bombs in sacred Hindu temples. The place is surrounded by the police, politicians who are anxious to win the Hindu vote, the media, and a huge crowd drawn by the spectacle. Set against post 9/11 scenario, amidst the craze for Valentine's Day, Britney Spears, Osama bin Laden, George W. Bush, and the American way of life, Anwar must now examine his options. In the end, Anwar gets shot by the cops and dies immediately. While dying, he has a vision of himself as Lord Krishna and his love Mehru as Meera, reuniting with each other. == Cast == * Siddharth Koirala as Anwar * Nauheed Cyrusi as Mehreen "Mehru" * Manisha Koirala as Anita * Rajpal Yadav as Gopinath * Vijay Raaz as Master Pasha * Yashpal Sharma as S.P.

Cinematography is up to the mark". ==References== ==External links== * Category:2007 films Category:2000s Hindi-language films Category:2000s romantic thriller films Category:Indian romantic thriller films Category:Films set in Uttar Pradesh Category:Films about terrorism in India Category:Films scored by Mithoon Category:Films shot in Lucknow Category:Indian interfaith romance films
