Athyrium angustum, the northern lady fern, is a fern native to northeastern North America. It was long included in the superspecies Athyrium filix-femina, but is now largely recognized as a distinct species. Athyrium angustum has a more southern counterpart — Athyrium asplenioides, the southern lady fern — that is very similar. The latter has a broader frond, especially at the base. ==References== aa ==External links== * angustum Category:Ferns of the United States Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America) Category:Flora of the Northeastern United States Category:Flora of Canada Category:Flora of Ohio Category:Plants described in 1810 Category:Flora without expected TNC conservation status
