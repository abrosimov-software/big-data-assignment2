The company had 130 employees, who were subjected to Taylorist management methods in order to increase productivity. In 1915, during World War I, the Leutner factory was evacuated to Kharkiv in Ukraine, to protect it from falling into the hands of the invading Imperial German Army. In Kharkiv the bicycle manufacturing plant was set up in the one of the workshops in M. Gelferihe-Zade's agricultural factory. Production was led by Rigan Alexander Feldmanis. Leutner's factory was located in Kharkiv from 1916 to the end of November, 1917 and manufactured 3600 DUX Bojevoj foldable army bicycles. After the revolution in Russia the Kharkiv Bicycle Plant (HVZ) was founded on the premises of Leutner's factory. For a long time Kharkiv's bicycles were simply called "leutners" by the locals. In 1923 A. Leutner and his family returned to Riga but did not set up the business again. Alexander Leutner died in 1923 in Merano. In 1924 in the premises of the Leutner's factory the Gustavs Ērenpreis Bicycle Factory moved in.Liepiņš Edvīns and Seregins Jānis, From Leutner to Erenpreis: 100 Years of Bicycle Manufacturing in Latvia.
