Aşiyan Museum () is the house of famous Turkish poet Tevfik Fikret (1867–1915) at Aşiyan neighborhood of Beşiktaş district in Istanbul. It was built in 1906 and later in 1945 converted to a museum. The museum is owned by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. ==Building== Tevfik Fikret lived in the house from 1906 until his death in 1915. The building was acquired in 1940 by the municipality from his wife Nazime with the initiative of Lütfi Kırdar, Mayor and Governor of Istanbul, and was converted into a museum named Museum of New Literature (). The museum opened in 1945. The museum was renamed Aşiyan in 1961 after the remains of Tevfik Fikret, which initially were buried at the Eyüp Cemetery, were taken to his home's yard he liked very much due to its panoramic view of Bosporus. Tevfik Fikret designed the architectural project of the house by himself, and named his house "Aşiyan", which means "nest" in Persian language. The house is a three-story wooden building within a garden. ==Museum== thumb|Aşiyan Museum, 2013 The ground floor consists of administrative offices.
